1. Project Structure (MERN Stack):
Frontend: React.js for the user interface.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js for the API.
Database: MongoDB for data storage.
Deployment: Host the application using a DevOps pipeline.
2. DevOps Workflow:
Step-by-step overview:

Version Control: Use Git/GitHub for versioning your codebase.
Containerization: Use Docker to package your MERN app into containers.
CI/CD Pipeline: Automate testing and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
Infrastructure: Use Kubernetes or Docker Compose for managing multiple containers.
Monitoring: Add logging and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
3. Action Plan:
Phase 1: Build the Application
Backend:
Set up a Node.js project.
Define RESTful API routes for books, users, and borrowing records.
Frontend:
Build UI components in React.js.
Integrate API calls to display and manipulate library data.
Database:
Create collections for books, users, and transactions in MongoDB.
Use Mongoose for schema definitions.
Phase 2: Containerization
Install Docker and create a Dockerfile for both the frontend and backend.
Use Docker Compose to link the frontend, backend, and database containers.
Phase 3: Automate with CI/CD
Write GitHub Actions workflows for:
Testing your codebase.
Building and pushing Docker images.
Deploying to a platform like Heroku or AWS.
Phase 4: Monitoring & Optimization
Use tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Prometheus for logging and performance monitoring.
